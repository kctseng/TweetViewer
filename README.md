# TweetViewer

> A simple website to query multiple Twitter Strings. Built using Vue as practice
> Must have own Twitter API keys to make it work.
> Also must run Chrome with no CORS for it to work since it is not a server side project.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
